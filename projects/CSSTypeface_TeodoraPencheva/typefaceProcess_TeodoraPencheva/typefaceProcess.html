                <p>
                    I began this project by sketching out some quick ideas for fonts. I was really inspired by our existence as humans, our experiences and physical form. First, I tried modelling letters after our bodies, trying to figure out which part best suits which letter. The idea itself offered a harmonious balance, but the letters themselves didn’t make sense together as well as I had hoped. Later, I found inspiration from some shoes I saw on social media. Their design was really interesting, so I made a quick sketch of some letters based off their shape. The letters seemed much more united, but I still found it a little bland.

                <p>
                    Eventually, I circled back to my inspiration from humans. I had been helping out my younger brother a lot with his online schooling, especially his writing and reading work. He still has very messy handwriting, and after staring at it for hours a day, I figured I might as well try something out with it. The process of our handwriting getting neater and more refined over the years is a really interesting concept to me, so I had him write onto a page which I then used to sketch on. It was really fun to use a grid over his writing and create a pixel font from it. So far, this was by far my most united font (which makes sense considering how it was drawn), but I felt wary about using it. Then suddenly, I decided to try out something different. I’m unsure how I got to the idea, but I thought it would be really interesting to see a font made out of the sparkle shape.

                <h2>Final Version</h2>
                <p>
                    Finally, I started creating my font. I started by dividing the sparkle shape into four and using the pieces to create the edges and lines of each letter. I added whole sparkles to the letters as I went by. Once I finished my set, I reviewed and compared them to see what needed to be fixed. For instance, the original “O” and “C” has the sparkles in the same places which made them to easy to misread. As seen in the pictures below, the “V”, “X”, and “Y” were too elongated. After making several changes, I settled on this design to use as my font.

                    When I began my process in coding the letters, I used an invisible grid to align all the shapes in place. As for the shapes themselves, I decided to combine two triangles to make the quarter pieces because making it a smooth curve made the letters appear too thin. Though, this decision made them appear much more angular than originally planned. All in all, I’m happy with how my CSS Typeface assignment came out.
