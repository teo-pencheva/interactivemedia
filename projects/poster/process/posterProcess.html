                <h2>Beginning Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    For this project, I was unsure what type of aesthetic I wanted to pursue. I decided to choose the Design School content package because it allowed for more experimentation. First, I began by searching for inspiration among graphic designs online. I found many that really got me going, but there were a few in particular that had a big impact on the design I decided to create for this project. First, is an image I saw posted on blog, though unfortunately, I couldn’t discern if it was created by them or someone else since I couldn’t trace it outside of the blog. Either way, this picture of four rectangular items stacked on top of each other haphazardly, inspired my to create the four animated grid items that turn when hovered over.

                <p>
                    Another image that inspired me is from the Humbug October 2020 program poster series by Berger & Co. While there were a lot of colours, I really liked how well they worked together and how clean it looked. Lastly, is the Belgian Art & Design Fair poster & website. Both of these inspired my palette, background, and shapes.

                    As for the beginning of the project, I created a few mock-ups in Adobe XD. Eventually I settled on creating the informational flip boxes and began creating my poster. Once I got started, I actually started to change up my design quite a lot. I began to flip-flop between ideas and layouts. It was really overwhelming, so I ended up going back to the drawing board, literally. After making one final, quick sketch, I began to program.

                    I’m actually slightly familiar with JavaScript, so I decided to use the canvas element to create a background for my poster as an alternative to using images. I made two functions to output the colorful bars that appear at the top and bottom of the page, along with conditions that limit the range of colours they can be. After refreshing the page, the lengths and colours of the bars change. In CSS, I followed along a reference to create the flip animation for my content boxes, though I had a lot of trouble trying to make everything fit properly. I also embedded the font I created as initials for the individual designers and links to their pages. I also thought it would be a good idea to turn the school header into a link to the school website. Overall, I like how my typographic poster turned out.
