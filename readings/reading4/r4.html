				<li>Why does Laurel Schwulst (Links to an external site.) advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</li><br>
				<p>In this article, Laurel Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media. She believes this because the web wouldn’t be what it is without all the individual websites that exist. If we were to rebuild the original architecture of the interconnected web, artists and other people need to come together to start creating their own sites, their own virtual worlds. This isn’t something I had considered before reading her article, though now I’m inclined to agree with her. I had never really considered websites as an artform prior to university, I didn’t take any consideration into their creation. However, now I know what I’m looking at and yet, finding individual websites is still very difficult for me to discover on my own. When you find such a site, it can be something so influential and entertaining. Exploring individual websites offers a benefitting experience you can’t get anywhere else, and I agree with Schwulst that artists and others alike should continue making and utilizing them over social media platforms.</p><br>

				<li>In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.</li><br>
