			<h2 id="message">A website could be cotton candy. It can be spun into existence so quickly, becoming wrapped around a thin base. Masked as something large, and yet, deceivably small. Something so overwhelming, it’s tooth rotting. A website can come in many colours and flavours. It’s a special snack that melts on the tongue faster than you can savour its taste. Likewise, consuming a website doesn’t need to be an extraordinary and fulfilling activity, a website can be a short experience. Afterall, cotton candy is still memorable regardless. Just at the mention of a website, people can become excited. Sometimes it can be handed out at grand gatherings where everyone comes together to have a taste. Addictively sweet, someone would say. Coming back to a website over and over again because how many chances can you get to visit a website like this? A website can be like cotton candy.</h2>
