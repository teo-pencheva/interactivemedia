				<li>Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.</li><br>
				<p>Personally, it doesn’t really matter to me, I think both have their own strengths, but for the sake of the argument, I’d say skeuo. Flat designs are much cleaner and simpler, and sometimes they are much faster to understand. Plus, they can fit into almost any aesthetics much easier than skeuo. However, that’s exactly why I would argue skeuo designs are better. Creating something complex with depth allows it to become much more recognizable as a brand or image. It’s much harder to confuse than flat designs. Moreover, there are a lot more options in the creation process for skeuo designs to make it one of a kind. Between the two, there are only so many flat designs you can make for something vs all the possible variations in making a skeuo. Overall, while there are strong arguments for either type of design, in my opinion, I think skeuo is the much more unique and interesting type.</p><br>

				<li>What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</li><br>
				<p>A zoopraxiscope is a device that plays a projection of a moving image. By inputing a transparent disc with drawings around its outside edge, a short animation is played. It relates to web and interaction design because the zoopraxiscope easily compares to the modern-day GIF. A short, generated clip played on loop that’s used by many. In web and interaction design, it’s easy to miss the influences because of how far we’ve come, but looped features on websites are a prime example. Speaking of which, another example that influenced digital design is the peepshow. It was a box with a missing side to allow the viewer to peer in on the insides. In there, the walls were painted to appear 3D from the outside perspective. Eventually, it served as inspiration for the kinetoscope and more, before influencing digital design in regard to perspective and three-dimensionality. Overall, the zoopraxiscope was one contraption that has an influence on web and interaction design.</p><br>

				<li>Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.</li><br>
				<p>I can't completely agree or disagree, because in my opinion, screens aren’t technically the ones that want flux. I think that screens are nothing more than a mirror of our own desires concerning design. If it’s anyone who wants flux, it’s us. With every change that gets made, it serves a purpose in making the screen better, faster, overall more efficient. Flux allows us to add so much variation and creativity to the screens. Altogether, it’s to benefit our experience and because of this, we’re constantly trying to improve and change what we have. Like Chimero states in his article, “What screens want needs to match up with what we want.” Thus, for screens to want flux, we need to want flux. In the end, I have to end up agreeing with the statement that screen want flux.</p>
