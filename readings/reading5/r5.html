				<li>In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</li><br>
				<p>In the opening paragraph of her post, Mindy Seu asks us to defamiliarize our tools. I think that it means looking past their purpose as tools and finding new, literal uses out of them. She believes it’ll allow us to realize the limits that these tools have and how to toy with and exploit them. Seu mentions this “poetic potential” that these actions carry. All of this relates her use of the word poetry, though it doesn’t mean any of this has to do with literal poems. One definition of the word poetry is, “…literature that evokes a concentrated imaginative awareness of experience or a specific emotional response through language chosen and arranged for its meaning, sound, and rhythm.” This is exactly what Seu is referring to in her post, at one point stating, “Better yet, technology is a form of language.” If technology was a language and we defamiliarize ourselves with its tools, its grammar or structure, we can put it together however we desire to create our own digital poem. It’s not about abandoning our tools, it’s about relearning their purpose and how to build something poetic out of it.</p><br>

				<li>Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</li><br>
				<p>One of the six categories Seu discusses within her taxonomy of tool poetics is Removing Function from Form. This section is all about, as the title states, removing function from form. Using types of interfaces and tools in ways beyond their intended nature. For instance, the fourpillars studio created a website where the attention is geared towards the scroll interactions. Typically, the scroll is a function that's purpose is to move the page so that the user can see more content. However, on this website, they used this tool to activate the content and create the illusion that the page is not moving. They removed it’s purpose as a tool and instead allowed it to become an outlet for an animation sequence.</p><br>
