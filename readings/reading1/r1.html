				<li>What are some challenges you face when giving a critique? </li><br>
				<p>Some challenges I face when giving a critique include speaking up and wording my thoughts properly. Often times, it's difficult for me to step up and offer my criticisms; a personal mental barrier. I struggle with social anxiety, and voluntarily breaking the silence to offer my thoughts is something I try very hard to overcome. As for the second challenge I face, my wording, surprisingly relates to my first issue. The reason why I'm reluctant to speak up in the first place is partially because I fear that I'll be misinterpreted or that I won't make any sense. It takes me an embarrassing amount of time to remember the proper vocabulary and terminology to use to be able to give an informative and perceptive response. Though, it all comes with practice. My challenges in giving a critique don't lie in my ability to discern what types of criticisms I should offer, but rather in my ability to communicate them effectively.</p><br>

				<li>How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?</li><br>
				<p>If I was given a critique I disagree with, I would handle it according to the critique itself. For instance, if it's about an artistic choice I made and I strongly stand by it, I may try defend it and take extra time to explain it more in-depth. Maybe I hadn't gotten my point across properly in my presentation. However, for the most part, I usually take it in stride. Even if I may disagree with it, I think it's important for me acknowledge and understand the critique. There is always something valuable that can be learned, whether it's in the artwork or the presentation, or something needing to be added or removed. It's very hard not to take a critique you disagree with to heart, but in the end you should listen through it. Though it is important to defend your work from being misinterpreted, there's always something that can be learned from a critique you disagree with.</p><br>

				<li>Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques?</li><br>
				<p>It’s important to give and receive critiques because it allows for growth. Giving critiques helps you learn from others, what to avoid in your own work or what you can use as inspiration. It teaches you how to build connections with other artists as well as how to critique your own work more effectively in private. Moreover, receiving one is important for growth because it brings an outsider’s perspective into focus. After starring at my work for hours or days on end, hearing what someone else has to say about it is refreshing. Additionally, the more you receive critiques, the better you become at digesting the feedback. It becomes easier to recognize the good intentions behind someone’s words. Critiques are important because they bring improvement and growth for everyone involved, and as the reading mentioned, are not about bringing an artist down.</p>
