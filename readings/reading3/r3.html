				<li>What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? </li><br>
				<p>I think Lialina’s opinion of the word “user” is that it shouldn’t be cast aside. She is of the opinion that we should redirect our attention to the concept of a general purpose user. Currently, there are many who are skeptical or plainly dislike the word user for the implications it carries. She states in her article, how they have been replacing the word “user” with the word “people” as if to appeal to a wider audience and make it seem more personal. However, Lialina describes this as an issue. Users predate computers, it was with users in mind that computers came into existence. The word has been used with purpose and respected for many years. Lialina states, “The Universal user is not a super user, not half a hacker. It is not an exotic type of user.” These are the implications that developers fear from the word  that she wants to clear up. The word “user” itself should not be forgotten.</p><br>

				<li>What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</li><br>
				<p>Lialina’s ideal internet user is someone who can get past the obstacles of internet applications. Her ideal user has many qualities that she goes on to describe in her article. It’s not necessarily someone who doesn’t need a specialized app, but someone who can find a way to complete their task without that specialized app, need be. Her ideal user should be able to figure out how to use different tools to complete their purpose. She states an instance of what an internet user should be capable of: “…a situation when the work flow of an application has gaps that can be filled by users, where smoothness and seamlessness are broken and some of the final links in the chain are left for the users to complete.” Lialina’s version of the internet user is that, “There is nothing one user can do, that another can’t given enough time and respect.”.</p><br>

				<li>From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</li><br>
				<p>There are many instances of situations where the gaps can be filled by the users. First, themes for a blog. There are many sites that allow for the user, should they be knowledgeable enough, to apply their own themes for their blogs. Be that, color schemes, layouts, or sound. Another instance of users filling in the gaps, is fixing broken code, like a broken or outdated image, or video. By using the provided developer tools, one can inspect code and the potentially resolve the issues that were present.</p>
